Object oriented programming
is a method of programming that attempts to model some process 
or thing in the world as a class or object.

An object is any entity that has attributes and behaviors. 
For example, a parrot is an object. It has

attributes - name, age, color, etc.
behavior - dancing, singing, etc.

class - a blueprint for objects.
 Classes can contain methods (functions) and attributes (similar to keys in a dict).
